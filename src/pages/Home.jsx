      <p>
        This project explores two real-world datasets using interactive and insightful visualizations:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Geospatial Dataset: Berkeley Earth (Climate)</h2>
      <p>
        An interactive map showing global temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2024 using color-coded markers. 
        Users can filter data by custom date ranges, zoom into regions, and visually analyze trends using a 
        meaningful color scale and legend.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Network Dataset: ca-HepPh (Collaboration)</h2>
      <p>
        A force-directed graph of author collaborations in high-energy physics, visualizing connections between 
        researchers based on co-authorship. Users can control the number of links loaded to balance performance 
        and insight.
      </p>
